  utter_what_is_ai:
  - text: AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is technology that allows computers and machines to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. This includes things like recognizing patterns, learning from data, making decisions, and even being creative. The key idea behind AI is to create systems that can think and learn in a way that mimics the human brain. This is done by feeding large amounts of data into complex algorithms and neural networks, which allow the AI to identify patterns and make predictions. Some common examples of AI in use today include virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa, self-driving cars, and AI-powered chatbots and content generators. As the technology continues to advance, the applications of AI are becoming more and more widespread across industries. The ultimate goal of AI research is to create general AI - systems that can match or exceed human-level intelligence and problem-solving abilities. However, this is still largely theoretical, and most current AI is focused on narrow, specialized tasks rather than broad, human-like intelligence. In summary, AI is the technology that allows machines to perform intelligent tasks, with the aim of replicating and even surpassing human cognitive abilities. It's a rapidly evolving field with exciting real-world applications. Northampton is a great place to learn more about AI on a theoretical and practical level. The students that created me actually studied AI at Northampton!
